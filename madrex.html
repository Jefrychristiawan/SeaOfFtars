            <h1>STORY</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                Mad-rex was born in such a Politan village, and he was born a naughty boy. Everyone in the village was
                annoyed by his trouble making nature. And such a childish personality didn't change even after Mad-Rex
                grew up. He had the same lust for money as his kind, but Mad-Rex hated learning and working. He would
                spend his entire day and free time, dreaming that he could miraculously get rich overnight.
                <br><br>
                The villagers disliked Mad-rex for his laziness, and they were subsequently thinking about chasing him
                out. This greatly angered Mad-Rex, who as a result sneaked into the village's sacred place, stole a
                precious item which was believed to be holy by everyone, and fled the place. The thing he stole was a
                treasure map. With the guidance of that treasure map, Mad-Rex arrived at the distant Albata. However,
                upon his arrival, he was disappointed by the what he saw.
                <br><br>
                There was nothing in view but desert sands and desolate ruins. All the marked locations on the treasure
                map were now covered in sand dunes and where nowhere to be found. Mad-Rex didn't want to give up like
                this. He kept going forward in his search for the legendary Los Pecados. He wanted to try his luck
                there. But Mad-Rex lost his way along the journey. He hadn't eaten on drunk anything for days, and now
                he just lied on the ground, tired and waiting for death.
                <br><br>
                But it was at this moment that a small dragon lizard appeared in front of him and guided Mad-rex to a
                water body. Maybe it was the gratitude he felt for it's help, maybe it was the same loneliness they
                shared together, or maybe it was just the fact that he needed a companion on his boring journey. Mad-Rex
                took this dragon lizard with him and agreed to put it on his backpack. Mad-Rex even named it Detona.
