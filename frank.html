                The Shura clan have thrived in isolation for countless generations, in the Arcapada universe. Their men,
                renowned for being the world's bravest fighters, and their women famed for being the world's greatest
                beauties. At the heart of the Shura clan's beliefs lies the legend of the Three Thousand Worlds. The
                legends speaks of three thousand secret worlds, which upon entering, one must face various levels of
                psychic and physical trials and advance to world after world upon victory. The people of the Shura clan
                had discovered a way to enter these worlds, and only those who have conquered over three hundred worlds
                could be granted the title of Ashura, raising them to the level of a demigod in the eyes of their
                people. However, in the innumerable eons of Shura history, none managed to conquer the fabled three
                thousand world, until Frank appeared.
                <br><br>
                With ambition and determination capable of shaking the very heavens, Martis trained every day of his
                life to become stronger, tirelessly advancing through the secret worlds, each personal breakthrough
                against the legions of demons granting him a sense of unique personal satisfaction. No one knew how many
                years passed before Frank reached the final and most hard core secret world. However, his desire for
                glory drove him onward. After numerous defeats, he fell into despair, but even then, he refused to give
                up. He transformed his sheer thirst for victory into his twin blades of righteous fury, now known as the
                Ashura's Teeth, and for countless days and nights, battled against the demons of the final world with
                strength and determination that had never been seen before on the mortal plane. He finally became the
                first Ashura to defeat the three thousand secret worlds and has ever since been regarded as the 'Ashura
                King', ruling, more than tens of milions of aspiring Ashura.
