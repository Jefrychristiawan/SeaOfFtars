                DEMONS? Anna's queasiness turned into slow, creeping dread. She could hardly make sense of her
                misfortune. Looking around at the damp, dingy walls of the castle, she thought of her pastel, sunlit
                room in Lumina City. She had warm baths, lavish banquets, and maidens attending to her every need. Now,
                all she had was a grim-looking knight named Leomord, who she thought was better suited patrolling the
                brigs than her hallway.
                <br><br>
                Still, she held on to hope. Perhaps, if she wrote to her father about the conditions of her new home, he
                might change his mind. Indeed, it would be ill-advised to have a poor girl like her take charge of such
                a dreadfully staggering fortress. As she was drafting her letter, her peace was disrupted by a commotion
                outside.
                <br><br>
                Apparently, a pile of thorns had been laid at the castle gate. The residents must be trying to
                intimidate me! Anna shivered at the thought. She immediately demanded for Ser Leomord to find the
                culprits. But to their surprise, the miscreants were just... a group of barefooted kids.
                <br><br>
                According to the kids, those thorns were called Moonlight Grass. Despite their horrendous appearance,
                the herbs could help calm one's mind when properly brewed. The folks of Ridgeburg sympathized with
                Anna's plight and simply intended to offer her comfort, though it evidently didn't go as well as they
                planned.
