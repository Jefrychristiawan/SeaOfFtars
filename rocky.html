                In a place called the Land of Dawn, in the Enchanted Forest for the Rift of the Abyss, the Blood Demons
                use their noble bloodline and extreme intelligence to enslave the Orc race, a symbol of barbaric power.
                <br><br>
                Orcs are a race with a long history, and perhaps the most common among those existing in the Land of
                Dawn. Through the mists of time, they were under the command of the Lord of the Abyss as they fought the
                fierce Endless War: they also engaged mankind in savage battle during the Golden Age. A series of
                successive defeats left them stronger and more united, semi-humans divided between Orcs, Minotaurs,
                Centaurs, among other types. Furthermore, they left them deprived of their homes, being forced into
                exile in the southern lands, where they achieved a meager existence.
                <br><br>
                Despite all this, it seemed that fate was not finished "playing" with this ancient race. As the Abyss
                invaded once more, powerful demons emerged again from the south posing a dangerous threat to Orc
                populations. Under the oppression of demons, the orcs split into small dogs, spread across the vast
                expanse of the Wilderness, being exploited to the full.
                <br><br>
                Rocky grew up in a traditional tribe of Orcs in the Wilderness and from an early age his father always
                taught all kinds of combat skills.
                <br><br>
                With this he also carries with him tales of the glory of the former Orcs; how they resided in their
                homeland north of the Lantis Mountains, their fierce upgrade millennia waged against elves and humans.
                His father hoped, then, that Rocky would be able to become a true Orc leader one day, in the hope that
                the former glory will be restored to his people.
                <br><br>
                More than twenty years later, Rocky became a powerful Orc with the help of his father's teachings.
