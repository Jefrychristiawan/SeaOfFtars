            <p>
                Although they have been integrating into human civilization for many years, and their appearance and
                habits are becoming closer to those of humans, many Moniyan's still hold hostility and wariness toward
                the Light Elves. It was in a village of such racial tension that Light grew up.
                <br><br>
                Due to its proximity to the Monastery of Light, most of the people in this village followed the outdated
                teachings of the monastery, and were unfriendly toward the Light Elves. The prejudices of the older
                generation also affected the children of the village, and Light was bullied and reviled by her peers for
                her unusual eyes and sharp ears for as long as she could remember, which led to her developing into a
                sensitive and withdrawn young Elf. She had no friends, and her only companion was a humble Silver Song
                flower.
                <br><br>
                Lonely little Light would sit beside this flower for hours on end, sharing all her woes and joys with
                it.
                <br><br>
                However, her only friend was eventually destroyed by the cruel children of the village. A group of boys,
                who often teased Light, spied Light talking to her floral friend one day and uprooted it on a cloudy
                afternoon, then bragged about it to anyone who would listen. When Light saw what they had done, she
                could no longer hold back her emotions. All the years of indignation and abuse gushed from her body in
                the form of pure rage, condensed into the power of lightning, and she almost flattened the surrounding
                houses.
