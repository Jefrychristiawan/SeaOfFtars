            <p>
                In the east of the Land of Dawn, between the old village Stream Valley and the Scarlet Shadow, a huge
                totem ruin stands among the mountains and forests. Some believe that it symbolizes a kind of faith or,
                as an oracle claimed, is guarding the land. Not far from it, there are mysterious stone steps covered by
                some leaves. The winding stone steps reach to the sky. Its destination is the Land of Xuan'ao, also
                known as the Land of Mystic Tortoise.
                <br><br>
                In a hundred-mile radius, the stone land is fringed by a cloud forest with an enormous shadow sitting in
                the center. It seems that he is cultivating himself. Meditation makes one keep away from disputes.
                However, the cloud begins to grow gloomy. There is a feeling of tension in the air. Suddenly, dozens of
                chains penetrate the clouds and some assassins land on the stone land. There is a word on their masks,
                Cyan. They want to lock Bulber with their chains. Fortunately, with the protection of his steel shield
                made with black ore, Bulber can safely release his power. Those assassins are beaten down, moaning in
                anguish. However, when one of these assassins mentions Cyan Finch, Bulber is astonished. He knows that
                it
                is the name of the best assassin of the Cadia Riverlands and how powerful he is. He knows that Cyan
                Finch is on his way to kill the Great Dragon. Bulber realizes that he must make an important decision
                now. This causes him to recall the unforgettable war that occurred hundreds of years ago.
