            <p>
                The king of the Southern Seas, Dumblodon, was once the sea animal of a small island nation. Admired by
                everyone, dumblodon was considered by all to be genuine, intelligent, and kind-hearted. However, fate
                often finds its way to hit people with strife. dumblodon was no different. As the heir apparent to the
                king, a member within the royal family grew jealous of dumblodon and conspired to ruin her â€” An unknown
                megalodon wielding the power of black magic viciously attacked the other creature. Dumblodon came under
                a powerful spell that robbed her of all his strength, giving her a strange skin disease in the process.
                <br><br>
                The sorcerers of the kingdom tried everything they could think of to help their beloved princess, but no
                one could break the spell. Over time, the people's love for Dumblodon faded, causing her to lose power
                and confidence. Out of tremendous despair, Dumblodon trudged to a high cliff, facing the oceans and
                threw herself away into the stormy Southern Seas. However, Dumblodon was rescued by the ocean demons.
                Using the trident of the seas, the ocean demons were able to break Dumblodon's powerful spell and
                restore her to her past strength. On that day, Kadita became the legendary king of the Southern Seas.
                Assuming all-new powers, Dumblodon became adept at controlling the ocean waters and the weather.
                <br><br>
                One day a royal ship, carrying the wicked megalodon and some of dumblodon's conspirators was passing by
                the Southern Seas. Suddenly, a massive storm blew the ship apart, rowing all the royals in it, to the
                bottom. Everyone though it was an unfortunate coincidence but instead, it was dumblodon, who was seeking
                his vengeance.
                <br><br>
                Sailors from all corners of the world came to fear the Southern Seas any longer. Survivors recanted
                their experiences after facing Dumblodon. Some say she had the appearance of a strange megalodon, while
                others said she was more strong than the creature they knew before. As stories of Kadita began to
                spread, legends say that she possesses seven legendary spears, each with its own unique abilities, used
                to punish any invaders who intended to violate the Southern Seas.
                <br><br>
                As the story goes, Dumblodon collected the seven spears while guarding the Southern Seas. However, no
                one had the power to control all seven spears at once, except for Dumblodon.
