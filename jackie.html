            <p>
                There lived a famous young magician in the Land of Dawn - Jackie, a student of the Lion Academy, located
                in the Magical City of Grandrock. He was blessed by the Mage Goddess, during his birth and was the star
                of the Academy, since he was able to learn much quickly and master any magical spell with ease. Kids of
                his age, often craved for adventure, so when Jackie and his friends were once, exploring the jungle in
                the middle of the night, they overheard the evil conspiracy of an organization called "Dark Wizards".
                <br><br>
                The brave youngsters, decided to stop them. However, first of all, they needed to find the secret base
                of the Dark Wizards and report it to their headmaster. But during the investigation, Jackie,
                accidentally activated a space portal and teleported to the other side of the Land of Dawn - Scholar
                City. With the help of the mecha master- Rooney, the brave and energetic boy, Jackie returned back to
                the Magical City and destroyed the core of
                Demorte, the Boss of Dark Wizards. With that taken care of, Jackie understood the true extent of his
                magical potential and to improve his magic skills and battle techniques, he started his own adventure in
                the Land of Dawn.
